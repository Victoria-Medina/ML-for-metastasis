This repository contains the code for my Master's thesis in Bioinformatics for Health Sciences at the University of A Coru√±a (Spain). The aim of the project is to use machine learning models to classify proteins into those involved and those not involved in metastasis. As well as to evaluate their performance. The datasets and results will be available after the publication to a research journal.
